                A broadcast packet must be processed by all devices in the same broadcast domain. A broadcast domain identifies all hosts on the same network segment. A broadcast may be directed or limited. A directed broadcast is sent to all hosts on a specific network. For example, a host on the 172.16.4.0/24 network sends apacket to 172.16.4.255. A limited broadcast is sent to 255.255.255.255. By default, routers do not forward broadcasts.
                Broadcast packets use resources on the network and make every receiving host on the network process the packet. Therefore, broadcast traffic should be limited so that it does not adversely affect the performance of the network or devices. Because routers separate broadcast domains, subdividing networks can improve network performance by eliminating excessive broadcast traffic.
                In addition to the 255.255.255.255 broadcast address, there is a broadcast IPv4 address for each network. Called a directed broadcast, this address uses the highest address in the network, which is the address where all the host bits are 1s. For example, the directed broadcast address for 192.168.1.0/24 is 192.168.1.255. This address allows communication to all the hosts in that network. To send data to all the hosts in a network, a host can send a single packet that is addressed to the broadcast address of the network.
